1) For dealing with large datasets that have small number of training sets: Can do following process
    a. train on the small datasets
    b. get the predicted labels for all datapoints
    c. Train again using the datapoints that are high confidence
    
2) Rerunning a training with random initialization can really help with overfitting

    a. Monitoring the train/validation split early could help to monitor whether the overfitting will
